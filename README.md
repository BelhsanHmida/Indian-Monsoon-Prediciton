## Project Overview
The Indian monsoon has a significant impact on agriculture and water resources in India. Accurate predictions of monsoon rainfall are crucial for planning and managing these resources. This project focuses on developing a robust strategy for selecting the best linear regression model to predict Indian monsoon rainfall.

## Notebook Structure
The notebook is organized into the following key sections:

1. **Introduction**
   - This section introduces the project, outlining its objectives and the importance of Indian monsoon rainfall prediction.
   
2. **Data Loading and Preparation**
   - Here, we load the datasets related to Indian monsoon rainfall and potential predictors, then clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
   
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - This section contains visualizations and analyses that help understand the data structure, trends, and correlations between predictors and the target variable.
   
4. **Criteria for Selecting a Regression Model**
   - We discuss various methods for selecting the best regression model, including cross-validation and the all-possible-regressions approach.
   
5. **Model Development and Cross-Validation**
   - This section implements linear regression models and applies cross-validation to evaluate model performance, focusing on the optimal number of predictors.
   
6. **Model Selection Strategy**
   - We use different selection criteria, such as the F-test and Mallow's Cp statistic, to identify the best linear regression model for predicting Indian monsoon rainfall.
   
7. **Conclusions and Insights**
   - This section summarizes the key findings from the project and discusses the implications for monsoon forecasting and future research.
